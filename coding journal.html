    	Today I read about java script and loops. I didn't really understand a lot of it, but I was able to get a general overview of it. I like how it camn cimplify a lot of things while it being very complicated itself. Making classes and lists are pretty confusing but fun too.

    	Today in class we started getting really serious about our projects. We are going to be presenting on Friday and I would really like my art studio code to be perfect.
