    	Today I read about java script and loops. I didn't really understand a lot of it, but I was able to get a general overview of it. I like how it camn cimplify a lot of things while it being very complicated itself. Making classes and lists are pretty confusing but fun too.

    	Today in class we started getting really serious about our projects. We are going to be presenting on Friday and I would really like my art studio code to be perfect.

    	We learned about making a swarm code, the first step is to figure out how to make all of the divs for the code. Next I had to get the image,trim it, then figure out how to make its location random. Finally I have to figure out how to clear the page.
